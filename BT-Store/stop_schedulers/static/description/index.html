        <p>
            <strong>Without this app</strong>, if you needed to stop
            all the schedulers because of a maintenance, or because something
            went wrong and you wanted to set the system in a <em>passive</em>
            way while having a look, you would need to go the
            the list of schedulers, <em>write down</em> which ones were active,
            and then disable them <em>one by one</em>. And more importantly,
            you would need to <em>remember</em> to set them active later.

            <strong>With this app</strong>, you can easily go to the
            general configuration of your system and choose between three
            options to inhibit all the schedulers of the system, depending
            on your needs.

            You can either:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Do not stop the schedulers:</strong>
            By selecting <em>No</em>, the schedulers behave
            normally, that is: if a scheduler is set as active,
            it will execute as expected, and if it is inactive, it
            will not execute.

        <p>
            <strong>Stop all the schedulers:</strong>
            By selecting <em>Yes, indefinitely</em>, the schedulers
            will not execute, no matter if they are set as active.
            To make them execute again as normal, simply set the
            option as <em>No</em> the next time.

        <p>
            <strong>Stop all the schedulers for a moment:</strong>
            By selecting <em>Yes, until the moment indicated</em>,
            the schedulers will not execute <em>until</em> the
            moment indicated in the field <em>Date &amp; Time</em>
            is reached, and from that moment on, they will execute
            again as normal.
